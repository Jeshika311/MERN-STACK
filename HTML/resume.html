                    As a first-year BTech Computer Science student at MM(DU), I am passionate about exploring the dynamic world of technology and software development. 
                    With a solid foundation in C++, I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills in areas such as algorithms, data structures, and software engineering.
                    I am committed to applying my learning through hands-on projects and internships, aiming to contribute to innovative solutions and gain practical experience. 
                    My goal is to leverage my technical skills to tackle real-world challenges and continuously grow in the field of computer science.
                    I am excited about connecting with professionals and peers who share my interests and look forward 
                    to opportunities that will allow me to learn, contribute, and make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
