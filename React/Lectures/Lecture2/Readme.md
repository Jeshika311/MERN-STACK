<!-- components :- in react we can also assume it as a function

we can make function based component and class based component

in earlier class is more used bcz it have hooks functionality and handles state but functions doesn't but in this time these finctionalities are also added to functions so we prefer and mostly use function based component

function based component :- it is just a function that gives you just code looks like html to render. we can create it by creating a function


props :- transfer data
access :- props.name , props.title

<UserCard name = "Juhi"/>          // in html if we write name like this then we day it attribute but in JSX it is called as prop

access props using (.)

the code in return statement is jsx -->
